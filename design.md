# REST API design model
The REST API will allow creation, retrieval, update and deletion of resources and information 
about persons and their homes.

# ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOLOGIES 

![Architecture](/architecture.jpg)

As you can see the project is based on a multi-layered application : 

 * The first layer is the Rest support implemented with Jersey, has the role of a facade (facade pattern - ACO module) and delegates the logic to the business or service layer
 
 * The Service layer is where the logic happens
 
 * The Data Access layer is where the communications with the persistence storage takes place.
 
 Now a few list of technologies used during this project : 
  
  1.JERSEY
  
    The Jersey RESTful Web Services framework is open source, production quality, 
    framework for developing RESTful Web Services in Java that provides support for JAX-RS APIs and serves as a JAX-RS Reference Implementation.
  
  2.SERVICE Layer (Domain)
  
    The package domain contains the POJOS.
    
  3.JPA And Hibernate (Persistence layer)
  
    We are using GenTestDao that implements a GenericDao to persist object using JPA and Hibernate.
    On the other hand, we have created a PersonDao class and HomeDao class and they both implement the GenericDao Interface.
    
  4.Tomcat (WEB CONTAINER)
  
    Everything gets packaged with Maven as a .war file and can be deployed on any web container â€“ We are using Tomcat.
